Preliminary Design Document Feedback
====================================

This is a very good start to your documentation.  I like the way you have
broken the project up and have presented the design for the first "phase"
of the project ~ very Agile thinking!

If this were intended to be a waterfall project, you would need a TON more
"requirements" in your functional section.  However, since that part is for
you to get a little experience with writing "shall" statements, what you
have is fine.  When you get to the detailed version, you'll be writing your
"requirements" as user stories anyhow.

Your ERD looks fine for this kind of database.  You have all the parts there
and I can see the associations quite easily.  Nice work!

REALLY nice work!
