grammar  :   1 point

Good answers on the chapter two questions.  You obviously have done the
reading, but have put the answers into your own words, which will help you
to remember the concepts, I'm sure!

Not taking off this time, but pay attention to your grammar ~ there are a
couple of places that need a bit of attention in the wording.  Take the time
to re-read, and don't just rely on the grammar checker...  :)

Total possible points: 15
Total possible score: 15 out of 15 = 100% which is an A-plus

Your score: 15 out of 15 = 100% which is an A-plus

Nice work overall.

So far this semester:

   homework01     15 of 15 = 100% of  5 points
   deliverable01  10 of 10 = 100% of 10 points
                             total:  15 / 15 = 100% which is an A-plus

Keep up the good work!!
